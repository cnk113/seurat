  This is a patch for an archived package Seurat. We were slow in fixing the errors and would like to get Seurat back on CRAN. In addition. the package we suggest, loomR, is currently under development and not yet available on CRAN. This package is not required for core functionality of Seurat.

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  Package suggested but not available for checking: 'loomR'
  
  Suggests orphaned package: ‘SDMTools’

  loomR is a suggested package hosted on a custom repository and maintained by us (both the package and repository).
  
  SDMTools is not required for any essential functionality. We are working to replace the function that calls SDMTools with a new function using non-orphaned packages.

* checking Rd cross-references ... NOTE
  Package unavailable to check Rd xrefs: 'loomR'

  This is a suggested package that we maintain. We have checked the cross references to ensure they link to the correct help pages.
